Chicken bindings for Selenium (http://code.google.com/p/selenium)

Very early stages.  Implements the JSON Wire Protocol
(http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol) and the
remote and Firefox webdrivers.

Currently the Firefox webdriver requires a profile directory.  You can
get the data I'm using for the profile at
http://parenteses.org/mario/misc/profile.tar.bz2.  Extract this
archive and give its full path to `with-firefox-webdriver' (see the
tests/firefox.scm file for usage example).
